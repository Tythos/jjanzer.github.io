Hi, my name is Jesse Janzer and I am a programmer currently working at [Tafi](https://maketafi.com) as the Director of Technology. We are developing a 3D avatar SDK called Astra which aims to be an engine agnostic character system.

I write software for a living and have been doing it professionally since 2002. I've worked on a variety of systems and technologies including PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, R, Java, Objective-C, Swift, C#, C, C++, GLSL/HLSL, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and others. I used to build websites, embedded software, and mobile apps. I ran a freelance software company called Tindr fulltime for about 6 years. Now I work in 3D engines like Unity and Unreal and implement and develop algorithms. I am currently studying math and machine learning.

I occasionally work on open source software on [github](https://github.com/jjanzer). I opensourced our previous [MCS](https://github.com/mcs-sdk/mcs) product and helped create the [Daz to Unity Bridge](https://www.daz3d.com/daz-to-unity-bridge).

I also occasionally post on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVBljercTqd_fWrKzN1mGFQ).
