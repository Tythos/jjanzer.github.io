<p>Hi, my name is Jesse Janzer and I am a programmer currently working at <a href="https://maketafi.com">Tafi</a> as the Director of Technology. We are developing a 3D avatar SDK called Astra which aims to be an engine agnostic character system.</p>
<p>I write software for a living and have been doing it professionally since 2002. I&rsquo;ve worked on a variety of systems and technologies including PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, R, Java, Objective-C, Swift, C#, C, C++, GLSL/HLSL, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and others. I used to build websites, embedded software, and mobile apps. I ran a freelance software company called Tindr fulltime for about 6 years. Now I work in 3D engines like Unity and Unreal and implement and develop algorithms. I am currently studying math and machine learning.</p>
<p>I occasionally work on open source software on <a href="https://github.com/jjanzer">github</a>. I opensourced our previous <a href="https://github.com/mcs-sdk/mcs">MCS</a> product and helped create the <a href="https://www.daz3d.com/daz-to-unity-bridge">Daz to Unity Bridge</a>.</p>
<p>I also occasionally post on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVBljercTqd_fWrKzN1mGFQ">youtube</a>.</p>
